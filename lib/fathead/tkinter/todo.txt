- createa a file (in cover/) of possible keywords.
- each doc file's title becomes the prefix.
- *.n docs have options, which become the suffix.
- parse the troff font changes into <em> and <strong>s..
- keep in mind the man.macro include.
- assume that lines not beginning with special chars
	all belong to the same paragraph. (figure out
	the real behavior later.)
- assume that special chars are either <dot> (i.e. '.')
	or <apostrophe>. (figure it out later.)
- get going! :)
